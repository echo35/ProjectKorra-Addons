# Project Korra Addons
by Echo35 (prev. @Carbogen)

##### Note: Unfortunately, I've lost the code for many of my old addons. Here are a few that have survived my numerous migration and backup fails.


These projects are addons for [ProjectKorra](http://projectkorra.com/). I will not be updating these, so I'm posting the source here to allow other devs to fork 
them.

Here are the [Official LavaSurge Page](http://projectkorra.com/resources/lavasurge.242/) and the [Official LavaSlap 
Page](http://projectkorra.com/resources/lavaslap.241/)
